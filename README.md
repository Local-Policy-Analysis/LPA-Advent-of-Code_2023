# LPA-Advent-of-Code_2023
 Shared repository for AoC23 - Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for all skill levels that can be solved in any programming language

## What is the meaning of this?

It's a fun daily puzzle which can also double up as an L&D opportunity for analysts of all skill levels and skill sets. 
This repository can act as a container for any LPA analysts with a github account who wish to participate. 

## To get started

If this sounds like fun, the visit AoC's homepage at https://adventofcode.com/ and create an account to view the daily puzzles (published every day throughout December).

## Using the repository 

Scripts can be written and stored in this repository - fork a copy onto your DAP and create a script in the relevent day's folder, then commit the change when your finished. The repo will be owned by LPA and pull requests can be approved by all members. Most challenges require an input of some kind, these will be placed in the input folder (if you're the first analyst to solve a day then please add this).

If you're new to github, a guide to collobrating (i.e. forking and commiting) can be found here: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world 

Any other questions do let Daniel Rowan or Peter Brohan know
